Subject: Please Manually Verify Domain - asset-tracer.com

Hi Resend Support,

I need help with domain verification for: asset-tracer.com

SITUATION:
- Added DNS records 24+ hours ago
- Clicked "Verify" button yesterday
- Still showing "Looking for DNS records..." for 24+ hours
- DNS records are confirmed correct via multiple tools

DNS VERIFICATION (Confirmed Working):
✅ SPF Record: v=spf1 include:resend.com ~all
✅ DKIM Record: Configured at resend._domainkey.asset-tracer.com
✅ MX Record: feedback-smtp.us-east-1.amazonses.com

VERIFIED WITH:
- nslookup (local DNS)
- dnschecker.org (global propagation)
- mxtoolbox.com (SPF validator)
- All show records are correct and propagated

API TEST RESULT:
When attempting to send via API, I receive:
"The asset-tracer.com domain is not verified."

REQUEST:
Can you please manually verify my domain? The DNS records are 100% correct and have been propagated globally for over 24 hours.

Domain: asset-tracer.com
Account email: mrlduiker@gmail.com
API Key ID: (ends with ...QUDS)

Thank you for your help!
