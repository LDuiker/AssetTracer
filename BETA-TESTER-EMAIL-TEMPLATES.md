We're looking for contractors to beta test it - completely free.

What's in it for you:
✓ Free access (worth $49-99/month)
✓ Help shape a tool built for contractors
✓ Keep preferential pricing forever
✓ We set it up for you

What we need:
• Try it for 2-4 weeks
• Tell us what you love (and what you'd change)
• Optional: Quick call to discuss

No contracts, no credit card required. Stop using it anytime if it's not helpful.

Want in? Just reply and I'll send access today.

Best,
[Your Name]
