## 📋 Production Database Scripts Reference

### Essential Scripts (Keep These!)

| Script | Purpose | When to Use |
|--------|---------|-------------|
| `INSTALL-OAUTH-TRIGGER-NOW.sql` | Install OAuth auto-provisioning trigger | After fresh database setup or if trigger is missing |
| `FIX-NEW-USER-NOW.sql` | Manually create profiles for existing auth users | If users signed up before trigger was installed |
| `FIX-RLS-POLICIES-V2.sql` | Fix RLS policies on all tables | If dashboard shows "Organization not found" or 500 errors |
| `DIAGNOSE-OAUTH-ISSUE.sql` | Comprehensive database health check | When troubleshooting auth or access issues |
| `TEST-RLS-AS-USER.sql` | Test RLS as authenticated user | After applying RLS changes |

### Diagnostic Scripts

| Script | Purpose |
|--------|---------|
| `CHECK-MISSING-TABLES.sql` | Verify all 14 tables exist |
| `QUICK-DATABASE-CHECK.sql` | Quick health check |
| `VERIFY-PRODUCTION-DATABASE.sql` | Detailed verification |

## 🔒 Security Status

### What's Protected:
- ✅ **Users** can only see their own profile
- ✅ **Organizations** are isolated from each other
- ✅ **Assets, Clients, Expenses, Invoices** are organization-scoped
- ✅ **Team invitations** are organization-scoped
- ✅ **Subscriptions** are organization-scoped
- ✅ **All data access** is authenticated and authorized

### RLS Policies Applied:
```
✅ 3 policies on users table (SELECT, UPDATE, INSERT)
✅ 3 policies on organizations table (SELECT, UPDATE, INSERT)
✅ 1 policy on each data table (ALL operations, org-scoped)
✅ Total: 23+ security policies active
```

## 🚨 Troubleshooting Guide

### Issue: "Organization not found" after login
**Cause**: RLS policies blocking access  
**Fix**: Run `FIX-RLS-POLICIES-V2.sql`

### Issue: New user redirected to landing page
**Causes**:
1. OAuth trigger not installed → Run `INSTALL-OAUTH-TRIGGER-NOW.sql`
2. Vercel deployed old code → Check commit hash in Vercel dashboard, redeploy without cache
3. Supabase URLs wrong → Verify Site URL and Redirect URLs

### Issue: User exists in `auth.users` but no dashboard access
**Cause**: Profile not created in `public.users`  
**Fix**: Run `FIX-NEW-USER-NOW.sql`

### Issue: 500 errors in browser console when loading data
**Cause**: RLS policies too restrictive  
**Fix**: Run `FIX-RLS-POLICIES-V2.sql`

## 📝 Key Lessons Learned

### Database Schema Discrepancies
- Production had `name` not `full_name` in users table
- Production had no `slug` column in organizations table
- Always verify actual schema before writing migration scripts

### RLS Policies
- After creating new tables, RLS policies must be explicitly set
- Default RLS policies are often too restrictive
- Must use `SECURITY DEFINER` for triggers that bypass RLS

### Vercel Deployment
- Frequently deploys old commits despite new pushes
- Always check commit hash in Vercel dashboard before testing
- Must manually redeploy with "Use existing Build Cache" UNCHECKED

### Supabase Configuration
- Site URL and Redirect URLs must match production domain
- OAuth providers must be explicitly enabled
- Service role key needed for admin operations (delete user, etc.)
