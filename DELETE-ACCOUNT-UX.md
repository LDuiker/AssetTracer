## Technical Implementation

### 1. Settings Page (`settings/page.tsx`)

**Updated `handleDeleteAccount`:**
```typescript
const handleDeleteAccount = async () => {
  setIsDeleting(true);
  try {
    const response = await fetch('/api/account/delete', {
      method: 'DELETE',
    });

    if (!response.ok) {
      throw new Error(data.error || 'Failed to delete account');
    }

    // Enhanced success message
    toast.success('ðŸŽ‰ Account deleted successfully! Thank you for using AssetTracer.', {
      duration: 4000,
      description: 'You can create a new account anytime.',
    });
    
    // Wait for user to see message
    await new Promise(resolve => setTimeout(resolve, 2500));
    
    // Redirect to homepage with parameter
    window.location.href = '/?deleted=true';
  } catch (error: any) {
    toast.error(error.message || 'Failed to delete account');
    setIsDeleting(false);
    setShowDeleteDialog(false);
  }
};
```

### 2. Landing Page (`page.tsx`)

**Added deletion detection:**
```typescript
useEffect(() => {
  const deleted = searchParams.get('deleted');
  if (deleted === 'true') {
    // Show welcome message
    toast.success('Account deleted successfully! ðŸ‘‹', {
      duration: 6000,
      description: 'Ready to start fresh? Create a new account below.',
    });
    
    // Auto-scroll to pricing
    setTimeout(() => {
      const pricingSection = document.getElementById('pricing');
      if (pricingSection) {
        pricingSection.scrollIntoView({ behavior: 'smooth', block: 'start' });
      }
    }, 1000);
  }
}, [searchParams]);
```
