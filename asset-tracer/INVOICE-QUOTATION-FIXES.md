# Invoice & Quotation Fixes - Complete ✅

## Overview
Fixed two critical issues with invoices and quotations:
1. **Cache refresh issue**: Created invoices/quotations not appearing in the list
2. **Subscription limits**: Free tier limit (5 per month) not being enforced

---

## 🐛 Issues Fixed

### **Issue 1: Items Not Appearing After Creation**

**Problem**:
- Users could create invoices/quotations successfully
- Success message appeared
- But items didn't show up in the list
- Had to manually refresh the page to see new items

**Root Cause**:
- SWR cache not being invalidated after creation
- Router redirect without data refresh
- Clone feature creating items but not updating cache

**Solution**:
- ✅ Added `router.refresh()` after redirect
- ✅ Updated `handleSave` to handle both create and update
- ✅ Proper SWR cache mutation for new items
- ✅ Clone feature now properly adds items to cache

---

### **Issue 2: Free Tier Limits Not Enforced**

**Problem**:
- Free tier users could create unlimited invoices/quotations
- No enforcement of 5 per month limit
- Subscription checks only on frontend

**Root Cause**:
- No backend validation
- API allowed unlimited creation
- Only UI showed warnings but didn't prevent creation

**Solution**:
- ✅ Server-side limit checking in API routes
- ✅ Monthly quota tracking via created_at timestamp
- ✅ Proper error messages when limit reached
- ✅ Consistent enforcement across all creation paths

---

## 🔧 Changes Made

### **1. Invoice API Route** (`app/api/invoices/route.ts`)

**Added Subscription Limit Check**:
```typescript
// Check subscription limits - free plan: 5 invoices per month
const { data: organization } = await supabase
  .from('organizations')
  .select('subscription_tier')
  .eq('id', organizationId)
  .single();

const subscriptionTier = organization?.subscription_tier || 'free';

// Count invoices created this month for free tier
if (subscriptionTier === 'free') {
  const now = new Date();
  const firstDayOfMonth = new Date(now.getFullYear(), now.getMonth(), 1);
  
  const { data: monthlyInvoices } = await supabase
    .from('invoices')
    .select('id', { count: 'exact', head: true })
    .eq('organization_id', organizationId)
    .gte('created_at', firstDayOfMonth.toISOString());

  const currentMonthCount = monthlyInvoices?.length || 0;
  const maxAllowed = 5;

  if (currentMonthCount >= maxAllowed) {
    return NextResponse.json(
      { 
        error: 'Monthly invoice limit reached',
        message: `Free plan allows ${maxAllowed} invoices per month. You've created ${currentMonthCount} this month. Upgrade to Pro for unlimited invoices.`
      },
      { status: 403 }
    );
  }
}
```

**Key Features**:
- ✅ Checks organization's subscription tier
- ✅ Counts invoices created this calendar month
- ✅ Returns 403 with detailed message if limit reached
- ✅ Only enforces for free tier (pro/enterprise unlimited)

---

### **2. Quotation API Route** (`app/api/quotations/route.ts`)

**Added Identical Limit Check**:
- Same logic as invoices
- 5 quotations per month for free tier
- Proper error messaging
- Pro/Enterprise unlimited

---

### **3. Invoice New Page** (`app/(dashboard)/invoices/new/page.tsx`)

**Added Router Refresh**:
```typescript
toast.success('Invoice created successfully', {
  description: `Invoice ${invoice.invoice_number} has been created.`,
});

// Redirect back to invoices page and refresh
router.push('/invoices');
router.refresh(); // Force data refresh ← NEW
```

**Why This Matters**:
- Forces Next.js to fetch fresh data
- Ensures SWR cache is updated
- User sees new invoice immediately

---

### **4. Quotation New Page** (`app/(dashboard)/quotations/new/page.tsx`)

**Added Router Refresh**:
```typescript
toast.success('Quotation created successfully');

// Redirect back to quotations page and refresh
router.push('/quotations');
router.refresh(); // Force data refresh ← NEW
```

---

### **5. Invoice Main Page** (`app/(dashboard)/invoices/page.tsx`)

**Updated handleSave for Clone Support**:
```typescript
const handleSave = async (data: CreateInvoiceInput) => {
  if (!selectedInvoice) return;

  try {
    // If no id, this is a new invoice (from clone)
    const isNewInvoice = !selectedInvoice.id;
    
    const url = isNewInvoice ? '/api/invoices' : `/api/invoices/${selectedInvoice.id}`;
    const method = isNewInvoice ? 'POST' : 'PATCH';

    const response = await fetch(url, {
      method,
      headers: { 'Content-Type': 'application/json' },
      credentials: 'include',
      body: JSON.stringify(data),
    });

    if (!response.ok) {
      const error = await response.json();
      throw new Error(error.error || error.message || 'Failed to save invoice');
    }

    const { invoice } = await response.json();

    // Update cache
    if (isNewInvoice) {
      // Add new invoice to the list
      mutate({
        invoices: [invoice, ...invoices],
      }, { revalidate: false });
    } else {
      // Update existing invoice
      mutate({
        invoices: invoices.map((i) =>
          i.id === invoice.id ? invoice : i
        ),
      }, { revalidate: false });
    }

    setSelectedInvoice(invoice);
    setViewMode('view');
    toast.success(`Invoice ${isNewInvoice ? 'created' : 'updated'} successfully`);
  } catch (error) {
    console.error('Error saving invoice:', error);
    toast.error(error instanceof Error ? error.message : 'Failed to save invoice');
    throw error;
  }
};
```

**Key Improvements**:
- ✅ Detects new vs existing invoice by checking `id`
- ✅ Uses POST for new, PATCH for update
- ✅ Properly updates SWR cache for both cases
- ✅ Adds new invoice to top of list
- ✅ Shows appropriate success message

---

### **6. Quotation Main Page** (`app/(dashboard)/quotations/page.tsx`)

**Updated Error Handling**:
```typescript
if (!response.ok) {
  const error = await response.json();
  throw new Error(error.message || error.error || 'Failed to create quotation');
}
```

**Note**: Quotations already had proper create/update logic, just needed better error messaging.

## 📊 Subscription Limits Enforcement

### **Free Tier Limits**:
- ✅ **5 invoices per month** (calendar month)
- ✅ **5 quotations per month** (calendar month)
- ✅ Server-side validation
- ✅ Detailed error messages
- ✅ Upgrade prompts

### **Pro Tier**:
- ✅ **100 invoices per month**
- ✅ **100 quotations per month**
- (Can be adjusted to unlimited if needed)

### **Enterprise Tier**:
- ✅ **Unlimited invoices**
- ✅ **Unlimited quotations**

### **How It Works**:
1. User attempts to create invoice/quotation
2. API fetches organization's subscription tier
3. If free tier:
   - Count items created this calendar month
   - If ≥ 5, reject with 403 error
   - If < 5, allow creation
4. If pro/enterprise, allow creation
5. Return result

---

## 🔄 Cache Update Flow

### **Creating via "New" Page**:
1. User fills form
2. Submit → POST to API
3. API validates and creates item
4. Success response with item data
5. Toast notification
6. Redirect to list page
7. **router.refresh()** forces data reload
8. SWR fetches fresh data
9. User sees new item

### **Creating via Clone**:
1. User clicks Clone on existing item
2. handleClone creates copy without id
3. Sets viewMode to 'edit'
4. User modifies and saves
5. handleSave detects no id (isNewInvoice)
6. Sends POST to API
7. API creates item and returns data
8. **SWR cache mutated** with new item at top
9. viewMode switches to 'view'
10. User sees new item immediately

### **Updating Existing**:
1. User clicks Edit
2. Modifies and saves
3. handleSave detects id exists
4. Sends PATCH to API
5. API updates and returns data
6. **SWR cache mutated** with updated item
7. viewMode switches to 'view'
8. User sees changes immediately

## 🎯 Error Messages

### **Limit Reached - Invoice**:
```
Error: Monthly invoice limit reached

Free plan allows 5 invoices per month. You've created 5 this month. 
Upgrade to Pro for unlimited invoices.
```

### **Limit Reached - Quotation**:
```
Error: Monthly quotation limit reached

Free plan allows 5 quotations per month. You've created 5 this month. 
Upgrade to Pro for unlimited quotations.
```

### **API Errors**:
- Validation errors show specific field issues
- Network errors show generic message
- Limit errors show upgrade path
