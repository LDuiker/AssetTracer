## 🔧 Critical: Database Migration Required

**You MUST run this migration** before the upgrade functionality will work:

```sql
-- Run in Supabase SQL Editor
ALTER TABLE organizations
DROP CONSTRAINT IF EXISTS organizations_subscription_tier_check;

ALTER TABLE organizations
ADD CONSTRAINT organizations_subscription_tier_check 
CHECK (subscription_tier IN ('free', 'pro', 'business'));
```

Without this, you'll get the error:
> "new row for relation organizations violates check constraint"

## 🔧 Developer Notes

### Type Definitions
All subscription tiers are strictly typed:
```typescript
export type SubscriptionTier = 'free' | 'pro' | 'business';
```

### Tier Checking
```typescript
const { tier, limits } = useSubscription();

if (tier === 'free') {
  // Show upgrade prompt
}

if (limits.maxAssets === Infinity) {
  // Unlimited assets
}
```

### Checking Limits
```typescript
const { canCreateAsset } = useSubscription();

if (!canCreateAsset(currentAssetCount)) {
  toast.error('Asset limit reached. Upgrade to Pro or Business.');
  return;
}
```

---

## ⚠️ Important Notes

### Database Constraint
**CRITICAL:** You MUST update the database constraint before upgrades work:

```sql
ALTER TABLE organizations
DROP CONSTRAINT IF EXISTS organizations_subscription_tier_check;

ALTER TABLE organizations
ADD CONSTRAINT organizations_subscription_tier_check 
CHECK (subscription_tier IN ('free', 'pro', 'business'));
```

### Team Members Error
The Team tab may show errors until you run `ADD-TEAM-MANAGEMENT.sql`:
- Adds `role` column to users
- Creates `team_invitations` table
- Sets up RLS policies

### Column Name
The users table uses `name` (not `full_name`):
- All APIs updated to use `name`
- TypeScript interfaces updated
- UI components use `member.name`
