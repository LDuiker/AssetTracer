## üîß Issues Fixed

### 1. **PDF Download Functionality** ‚úÖ
**Problem**: PDF download was failing because the `invoice-pdf.tsx` file didn't exist.

**Solution**:
- Created `lib/pdf/invoice-pdf.tsx` component using `@react-pdf/renderer`
- Mirrored the structure from `quotation-pdf.tsx`
- Includes:
  - Professional invoice layout
  - Company and client information
  - Line items table
  - Subtotal, tax, and total calculations
  - Notes and terms sections
  - Status badges with color coding
  - Footer with generation timestamp

**Files Modified**:
- ‚úÖ Created `lib/pdf/invoice-pdf.tsx`

### 2. **Payment Link Feature Removed** ‚úÖ
**Problem**: User requested removal of DPO payment link integration.

**Solution**:
- Removed `handleGeneratePaymentLink` function from `invoices/page.tsx`
- Removed `onGeneratePaymentLink` prop from `InvoiceTable` component
- Removed `onGeneratePaymentLink` prop from `InvoiceViewPanel` component
- Removed "Generate Payment Link" button from invoice view panel
- Removed "Generate Payment Link" menu item from invoice table dropdown
- Removed payment link display section
- Cleaned up unused imports (`Link2`, `ExternalLink`, `CreditCard`)

**Files Modified**:
- ‚úÖ `app/(dashboard)/invoices/page.tsx`
- ‚úÖ `components/invoices/InvoiceTable.tsx`
- ‚úÖ `components/invoices/InvoiceViewPanel.tsx`

---

### 3. **Currency Options Mismatch** ‚úÖ
**Problem**: Invoice form had different currency options (USD, EUR, GBP, CAD, AUD) compared to quotations and settings (USD, EUR, GBP, BWP, ZAR).

**Solution**:
- Updated `InvoiceForm.tsx` currency dropdown to match quotations
- Now includes: USD, EUR, GBP, BWP, ZAR
- Consistent across all forms and settings

**Files Modified**:
- ‚úÖ `components/invoices/InvoiceForm.tsx`

**Before**:
```tsx
<SelectItem value="USD">USD - US Dollar</SelectItem>
<SelectItem value="EUR">EUR - Euro</SelectItem>
<SelectItem value="GBP">GBP - British Pound</SelectItem>
<SelectItem value="CAD">CAD - Canadian Dollar</SelectItem>
<SelectItem value="AUD">AUD - Australian Dollar</SelectItem>
```

**After**:
```tsx
<SelectItem value="USD">USD - US Dollar</SelectItem>
<SelectItem value="EUR">EUR - Euro</SelectItem>
<SelectItem value="GBP">GBP - British Pound</SelectItem>
<SelectItem value="BWP">BWP - Botswana Pula</SelectItem>
<SelectItem value="ZAR">ZAR - South African Rand</SelectItem>
```

### 4. **Total Value Replaced with Total Payments** ‚úÖ
**Problem**: The analytics card showed "Total Value" (sum of all invoices) instead of "Total Payments" (sum of paid invoices only).

**Solution**:
- Updated the third analytics card label from "Total Value" to "Total Payments"
- Changed the displayed value from `stats.totalValue` to `stats.totalPaid`
- Now accurately shows only the total amount from paid invoices

**Files Modified**:
- ‚úÖ `app/(dashboard)/invoices/page.tsx`

**Before**:
```tsx
<p className="text-sm font-medium text-gray-600 dark:text-gray-400 mb-1">
  Total Value
</p>
<p className="text-3xl font-bold text-purple-600 dark:text-purple-400">
  {formatCurrency(stats.totalValue)}
</p>
```

**After**:
```tsx
<p className="text-sm font-medium text-gray-600 dark:text-gray-400 mb-1">
  Total Payments
</p>
<p className="text-3xl font-bold text-purple-600 dark:text-purple-400">
  {formatCurrency(stats.totalPaid)}
</p>
```

## üìä Analytics Cards Now Show:

1. **Invoices Sent** (Blue) - Count of sent invoices
2. **Paid Invoices** (Green) - Count of paid invoices
3. **Total Payments** (Purple) - **Sum of only paid invoice amounts**
