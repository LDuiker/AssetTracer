```typescript
// Always downgraded to 'free'
const { data } = await supabase
  .from('organizations')
  .update({ subscription_tier: 'free' })
```

**After:**
```typescript
// Accepts optional tier parameter
const targetTier = body.tier || 'free'; // Can be 'free' or 'pro'

const { data } = await supabase
  .from('organizations')
  .update({ subscription_tier: targetTier })
```

**Request Body:**
```json
{
  "tier": "pro"  // Optional: defaults to 'free'
}
```

### UI Component: `BillingSection.tsx`
