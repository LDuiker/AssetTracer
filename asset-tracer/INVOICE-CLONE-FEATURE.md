# Invoice Clone Feature - Complete ✅

## Overview
Added the clone feature to the invoice page, matching the implementation from the quotations page. Users can now quickly duplicate existing invoices to create new ones with updated dates and draft status.

---

## 🔧 Implementation Details

### 1. **Clone Handler** (`app/(dashboard)/invoices/page.tsx`)

```typescript
const handleClone = (invoice: Invoice) => {
  // Create a clone without the id and with updated dates
  const clonedInvoice = {
    ...invoice,
    id: undefined, // Remove id so it creates a new one
    invoice_number: undefined, // Will be auto-generated
    status: 'draft' as const,
    issue_date: new Date().toISOString().split('T')[0],
    due_date: new Date(Date.now() + 30 * 24 * 60 * 60 * 1000).toISOString().split('T')[0],
    paid_date: undefined, // Clear paid date
    payment_link: undefined, // Clear payment link
  };

  setSelectedInvoice(clonedInvoice as any);
  setViewMode('edit');

  toast.info(`Cloning invoice ${invoice.invoice_number}`);
};
```

**Key Features**:
- ✅ Removes unique identifiers (id, invoice_number)
- ✅ Sets status to 'draft'
- ✅ Updates issue_date to today
- ✅ Sets due_date to 30 days from today
- ✅ Clears payment-related fields (paid_date, payment_link)
- ✅ Opens in edit mode for immediate customization
- ✅ Shows toast notification

### 2. **InvoiceTable Component** (`components/invoices/InvoiceTable.tsx`)

**Added**:
- `onClone` prop to interface
- Clone menu item in dropdown menu
- Copy icon import

**Dropdown Menu Item**:
```typescript
<DropdownMenuItem
  onClick={() => onClone(invoice)}
  className="cursor-pointer"
>
  <Copy className="mr-2 h-4 w-4" />
  <span>Clone</span>
</DropdownMenuItem>
```

**Location**: Between "Download PDF" and "Mark as Paid"

---

### 3. **InvoiceViewPanel Component** (`components/invoices/InvoiceViewPanel.tsx`)

**Added**:
- `onClone` prop to interface (optional)
- Clone button in header actions

**Clone Button**:
```typescript
{onClone && (
  <Button variant="outline" size="sm" onClick={onClone}>
    <Copy className="h-4 w-4 mr-2" />
    Clone
  </Button>
)}
```

**Location**: Between "PDF" and "Mark as Paid" buttons
