## Overview

## 🔧 Changes Made

### 1. **Conversion Rate Calculation** ✅

**Before** (Incorrect):
```typescript
// Calculate conversion rate (accepted / sent + accepted)
const totalSentAndAccepted = sent + accepted;
const conversionRate = totalSentAndAccepted > 0 
  ? (accepted / totalSentAndAccepted) * 100 
  : 0;
```
- Only considered "sent" and "accepted" quotations
- Ignored draft, rejected, expired, and invoiced quotations
- Gave inflated conversion rate

**After** (Correct):
```typescript
// Calculate conversion rate (accepted / total quotations) * 100
const conversionRate = total > 0 
  ? (accepted / total) * 100 
  : 0;
```
- Considers **all quotations** (draft, sent, accepted, rejected, expired, invoiced)
- Shows true percentage of quotations that were accepted
- More accurate sales performance metric

**Example**:
- 10 total quotations: 2 draft, 3 sent, 4 accepted, 1 rejected
- **Before**: (4 / (3 + 4)) × 100 = 57.14% ❌ (inflated)
- **After**: (4 / 10) × 100 = 40% ✅ (accurate)

### 2. **"Quotes Sent" → "Rejected Quotes"** ✅

**Before**:
- Card Label: "Quotes Sent"
- Color: Blue
- Icon: TrendingUp
- Value: `stats.sent` (only "sent" status quotations)

**After**:
- Card Label: **"Rejected Quotes"**
- Color: **Red** (alert color)
- Icon: **XCircle** (indicates rejection)
- Value: `stats.rejected` (quotations that were rejected)

**Calculation**:
```typescript
const rejected = quotations.filter((q) => q.status === 'rejected').length;
```
- Shows count of quotations that clients rejected
- More actionable metric for improving sales process

## 💡 Business Insights

### **Why "Rejected Quotes" is Better Than "Quotes Sent"**

**"Quotes Sent":**
- ❌ Doesn't indicate success or failure
- ❌ Not actionable
- ❌ Just a step in the process

**"Rejected Quotes":**
- ✅ Highlights lost opportunities
- ✅ Indicates areas for improvement
- ✅ Actionable - can analyze why quotes were rejected
- ✅ Helps improve pricing, terms, or sales approach

### **Why Accurate Conversion Rate Matters**

**Old Formula (Inflated)**:
- Made performance look better than reality
- Only counted quotations that progressed far enough
- Missed the full picture

**New Formula (Accurate)**:
- Shows true win rate across all quotations
- Helps set realistic targets
- Enables better forecasting
- Identifies process bottlenecks
