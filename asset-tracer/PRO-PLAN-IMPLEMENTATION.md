## üìã Changes Made

### 1. Database Schema

#### File: `supabase/ADD-SUBSCRIPTION-TIER.sql`

Added the following columns to the `organizations` table:

```sql
subscription_tier TEXT DEFAULT 'free'
subscription_status TEXT DEFAULT 'active'
subscription_start_date TIMESTAMP
subscription_end_date TIMESTAMP
stripe_customer_id TEXT
stripe_subscription_id TEXT
```

**Migration Steps:**
1. Navigate to Supabase Dashboard ‚Üí SQL Editor
2. Copy and paste the contents of `ADD-SUBSCRIPTION-TIER.sql`
3. Click "Run" to execute the migration
4. Verify columns were added successfully

### 2. TypeScript Types

#### File: `lib/context/OrganizationContext.tsx`

Updated the `Organization` interface to include subscription fields:

```typescript
interface Organization {
  id: string;
  name: string;
  subscription_tier?: string;
  subscription_status?: string;
  subscription_start_date?: string | null;
  subscription_end_date?: string | null;
  created_at: string;
  updated_at: string;
}
```

### 3. Subscription Context

#### File: `lib/context/SubscriptionContext.tsx`

**Before:**
```typescript
const tier: SubscriptionTier = 'free'; // Hardcoded
```

**After:**
```typescript
const tier: SubscriptionTier = (organization?.subscription_tier as SubscriptionTier) || 'free';
```

Now dynamically fetches the subscription tier from the organization data.

### 4. Billing UI Component

#### File: `components/settings/BillingSection.tsx`

Created a comprehensive billing management component with:

- **Current Plan Display:** Shows active plan with features and pricing
- **Usage Stats:** Displays current limits for assets, inventory, quotations, and users
- **Upgrade Button:** For Free tier users to upgrade to Pro
- **Downgrade Button:** For Pro tier users to downgrade to Free
- **Plan Comparison:** Side-by-side comparison of Free vs Pro features
- **Error Handling:** User-friendly error messages
- **Loading States:** Smooth loading indicators during upgrades/downgrades

### 5. Settings Page Integration

#### File: `app/(dashboard)/settings/page.tsx`

**Changes:**
- Added "Billing" tab to settings navigation
- Updated grid from 5 columns to 6 columns to accommodate new tab
- Imported and integrated `BillingSection` component
- Added necessary icons (`CreditCard`, `Check`, `Zap`)

### 6. API Routes

#### File: `app/api/subscription/upgrade/route.ts`

**Endpoint:** `POST /api/subscription/upgrade`

**Request Body:**
```json
{
  "tier": "pro"  // or "enterprise"
}
```

**Response:**

```

**Features:**

## üìù Manual Upgrade (Development/Testing)

If you need to manually upgrade an organization to Pro tier (for development or testing):

```sql
-- Replace [org-id] with your organization ID
UPDATE organizations
SET subscription_tier = 'pro',
    subscription_status = 'active',
    subscription_start_date = NOW(),
    subscription_end_date = NULL
WHERE id = '[org-id]';
```

To find your organization ID:

```sql
-- Replace with your email
SELECT o.id, o.name, o.subscription_tier, u.email
FROM organizations o
JOIN users u ON u.organization_id = o.id
WHERE u.email = 'your-email@example.com';
```
