# Quotations View & Edit Fix

## Issues Fixed

### 1. Edit Function Not Working Properly
**Problem**: When clicking "Edit" on a quotation, the dialog opened but the items were not loaded, making it impossible to edit the quotation properly.

**Root Cause**: The `getQuotations()` function in `lib/db/quotations.ts` was fetching quotations and clients, but **not fetching the quotation items** from the `quotation_items` table.

**Solution**: Updated `getQuotations()` to fetch quotation items separately and map them to their respective quotations.

```typescript
// Now fetches:
1. Quotations (basic data)
2. Clients (for client information)
3. Quotation Items (line items for each quotation)

// Then maps them together:
const quotationsWithClientsAndItems = data.map(quotation => {
  const client = clients?.find(c => c.id === quotation.client_id);
  const quotationItems = items?.filter(item => item.quotation_id === quotation.id) || [];
  return {
    ...quotation,
    client: client || null,
    items: quotationItems, // ✅ Now includes items!
  };
});
```

### 2. View Function Not Implemented
**Problem**: Clicking "View Details" only showed a toast message saying "Quotation view coming soon".

**Solution**: Created a new `QuotationViewDialog` component that displays:
- ✅ Quotation number and status badge
- ✅ Client information (name, company, email)
- ✅ Quotation details (issue date, valid until, currency, status)
- ✅ Line items table (description, quantity, unit price, tax %, amount)
- ✅ Totals breakdown (subtotal, tax total, grand total)
- ✅ Notes (if any)
- ✅ Terms & conditions (if any)
- ✅ Action buttons (Close, Edit)

The view dialog provides a read-only, professional view of the quotation with an option to edit directly from the view.
