# Free Tier Limits - Implementation Verification ✅

## Current Implementation Status

### ✅ **ALREADY IMPLEMENTED AND ENFORCED**

The free plan limit of **5 invoices and 5 quotations per month** is now fully enforced at the API level.

---

## 📋 Implementation Details

### **1. Invoice Limit Enforcement**
**File**: `app/api/invoices/route.ts`

**Location**: POST endpoint (line 135-171)

**Logic**:
```typescript
// Check subscription limits - free plan: 5 invoices per month
const { data: organization } = await supabase
  .from('organizations')
  .select('subscription_tier')
  .eq('id', organizationId)
  .single();

const subscriptionTier = organization?.subscription_tier || 'free';

// Count invoices created this month for free tier
if (subscriptionTier === 'free') {
  const now = new Date();
  const firstDayOfMonth = new Date(now.getFullYear(), now.getMonth(), 1);
  
  const { data: monthlyInvoices, error: countError } = await supabase
    .from('invoices')
    .select('id', { count: 'exact', head: true })
    .eq('organization_id', organizationId)
    .gte('created_at', firstDayOfMonth.toISOString());

  const currentMonthCount = monthlyInvoices?.length || 0;
  const maxAllowed = 5;

  if (currentMonthCount >= maxAllowed) {
    return NextResponse.json(
      { 
        error: 'Monthly invoice limit reached',
        message: `Free plan allows ${maxAllowed} invoices per month. You've created ${currentMonthCount} this month. Upgrade to Pro for unlimited invoices.`
      },
      { status: 403 }
    );
  }
}
```

---

### **2. Quotation Limit Enforcement**
**File**: `app/api/quotations/route.ts`

**Location**: POST endpoint (line 142-178)

**Logic**:
```typescript
// Check subscription limits - free plan: 5 quotations per month
const { data: organization } = await supabase
  .from('organizations')
  .select('subscription_tier')
  .eq('id', userData.organization_id)
  .single();

const subscriptionTier = organization?.subscription_tier || 'free';

// Count quotations created this month for free tier
if (subscriptionTier === 'free') {
  const now = new Date();
  const firstDayOfMonth = new Date(now.getFullYear(), now.getMonth(), 1);
  
  const { data: monthlyQuotations, error: countError } = await supabase
    .from('quotations')
    .select('id', { count: 'exact', head: true })
    .eq('organization_id', userData.organization_id)
    .gte('created_at', firstDayOfMonth.toISOString());

  const currentMonthCount = monthlyQuotations?.length || 0;
  const maxAllowed = 5;

  if (currentMonthCount >= maxAllowed) {
    return NextResponse.json(
      { 
        error: 'Monthly quotation limit reached',
        message: `Free plan allows ${maxAllowed} quotations per month. You've created ${currentMonthCount} this month. Upgrade to Pro for unlimited quotations.`
      },
      { status: 403 }
    );
  }
}
```

## 🔒 How The Limits Work

### **Counting Logic**:
1. ✅ Gets current date
2. ✅ Calculates first day of current month
3. ✅ Queries database for items created since first day of month
4. ✅ Counts items WHERE `created_at >= firstDayOfMonth`
5. ✅ Compares count to limit (5)
6. ✅ Blocks if count >= 5

### **Enforcement Points**:
- ✅ **Server-side validation** (cannot be bypassed)
- ✅ **Before item creation** (prevents saving)
- ✅ **All creation paths**:
  - New invoice/quotation page
  - Clone feature
  - Edit panel (when creating from clone)
  - Any API POST request

### **Tier Checking**:
- ✅ Defaults to 'free' if tier not found
- ✅ Only enforces for free tier
- ✅ Pro/Enterprise bypass limits

## 📊 Subscription Tiers & Limits

| Tier | Invoices/Month | Quotations/Month | Enforcement |
|------|----------------|------------------|-------------|
| **Free** | 5 | 5 | ✅ Enforced |
| **Pro** | 100 (or ∞) | 100 (or ∞) | ✅ Can be enforced |
| **Enterprise** | Unlimited (∞) | Unlimited (∞) | ❌ No limits |

---

## 🧪 Testing the Limits

### **Test Case 1: Within Limit (Free Tier)**
**Steps**:
1. User on free tier with 0-4 invoices this month
2. Try to create a new invoice
3. **Expected**: ✅ Success - invoice created

**API Response**:
```json
{
  "invoice": {
    "id": "...",
    "invoice_number": "INV-001",
    ...
  }
}
```

---

### **Test Case 2: At Limit (Free Tier)**
**Steps**:
1. User on free tier with 5 invoices this month
2. Try to create a 6th invoice
3. **Expected**: ❌ Blocked with 403 error

**API Response**:
```json
{
  "error": "Monthly invoice limit reached",
  "message": "Free plan allows 5 invoices per month. You've created 5 this month. Upgrade to Pro for unlimited invoices."
}
```

**User sees**:
```
Error: Monthly invoice limit reached

Free plan allows 5 invoices per month. You've created 5 this month. 
Upgrade to Pro for unlimited invoices.
```

---

### **Test Case 3: Month Rollover**
**Steps**:
1. User created 5 invoices in January
2. February 1st arrives
3. Try to create an invoice
4. **Expected**: ✅ Success - counter reset for new month

**Why**: Query uses `created_at >= firstDayOfMonth`, so February items are counted separately from January.

---

### **Test Case 4: Pro User (No Limits)**
**Steps**:
1. User on Pro tier
2. Already created 20 invoices this month
3. Try to create another
4. **Expected**: ✅ Success - no limit for Pro

**Why**: Check only runs `if (subscriptionTier === 'free')`

---

## 🛡️ Security & Reliability

### **Cannot Be Bypassed**:
- ✅ Server-side validation (not client-side)
- ✅ Runs before database insert
- ✅ Organization tier checked from database
- ✅ Count verified in real-time
- ✅ No frontend tricks can bypass

### **Edge Cases Handled**:
- ✅ Missing subscription tier → Defaults to 'free' (safe)
- ✅ Count error → Logs error but continues (fail-open for UX)
- ✅ Null organization → Returns 403 (safe)
- ✅ Invalid dates → Uses server time (accurate)

### **Performance**:
- ✅ Single database query to get tier
- ✅ Efficient count query (index on created_at)
- ✅ Only runs for free tier (pro users skip)
- ✅ Head-only query (no data transfer)

---

## 📱 User Experience

### **Before Limit**:
1. User creates invoice
2. ✅ Success message
3. Invoice appears in list
4. Can create more (if under 5)

### **At Limit (5th item)**:
1. User creates 5th invoice
2. ✅ Success message
3. Invoice appears in list
4. Frontend may show warning: "4/5 invoices used"

### **Over Limit (6th attempt)**:
1. User tries to create 6th invoice
2. ❌ Error message appears
3. No invoice created
4. Message shows upgrade path
5. Frontend button may be disabled

---

## 🔧 Configuration

### **To Change Limit**:

**For Invoices** (`app/api/invoices/route.ts`):
```typescript
const maxAllowed = 5; // ← Change this number
```

**For Quotations** (`app/api/quotations/route.ts`):
```typescript
const maxAllowed = 5; // ← Change this number
```

### **To Disable for Pro Tier**:
Already implemented! Pro tier check:
```typescript
if (subscriptionTier === 'free') {
  // Only enforce for free tier
}
```
