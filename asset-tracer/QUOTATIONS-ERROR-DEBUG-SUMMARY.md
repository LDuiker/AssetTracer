## üîç How to Diagnose the Issue

```
1. Press F12 to open DevTools
2. Go to Console tab
3. Refresh the quotations page
4. Look for errors starting with:
   - "Error in GET /api/quotations:"
   - "Error fetching quotations:"
5. Copy the EXACT error message
```

### Step 2: Check Network Tab
```
1. In DevTools, go to Network tab
2. Refresh the page
3. Find the request to /api/quotations
4. Click on it
5. Check the Response tab
6. Note the status code (200, 401, 404, 500, etc.)
```

### Step 3: Run Diagnostic SQL
```

2. SQL Editor
3. Run: supabase/DIAGNOSE-QUOTATIONS.sql

## üéØ Most Likely Causes

Based on "works once then fails" pattern:

### 1. **Missing Clients** (Most Likely)
- Quotations need clients to work
- If no clients exist, query might partially fail
- **Fix**: Create clients first at `/clients` page

### 2. **RLS Policy Timing Issue**
- RLS policies might be inconsistent
- Session state might not persist
- **Fix**: Re-run CREATE-QUOTATIONS-TABLES.sql

### 3. **Organization Link Issue**
- User might not be consistently linked to org
- Auth session might be refreshing
- **Fix**: Check user's organization_id

### 4. **Supabase Connection**
- Network timeout or connection issue
- Supabase server response delay
- **Fix**: Check Supabase project status

## üöÄ Quick Fixes to Try (In Order)

### Fix 1: Create Clients
```
1. Go to /clients page
2. Create at least one client
3. Go back to /quotations
4. Refresh the page
```

### Fix 2: Check Browser Console
```
1. Open F12
2. Go to Console tab
3. Refresh /quotations page
4. Read the exact error message
5. Follow the specific fix for that error
```

### Fix 3: Run Diagnostic
```sql
-- In Supabase SQL Editor
-- Run: DIAGNOSE-QUOTATIONS.sql
-- Check all the output
-- Fix any issues found
```

### Fix 4: Verify Organization Link
```sql
-- In Supabase SQL Editor
SELECT id, email, organization_id 
FROM users 
WHERE id = auth.uid();

-- If organization_id is NULL:
UPDATE users 
SET organization_id = (SELECT id FROM organizations LIMIT 1)
WHERE id = auth.uid();
```

### Fix 5: Hard Refresh
```
1. Clear browser cache
2. Hard refresh: Ctrl+Shift+R (Windows) or Cmd+Shift+R (Mac)
