# Invoice Analytics Fix - Complete ✅

## Overview
Fixed the payment rate calculation and replaced "Invoices Sent" with "Unpaid Invoices" for better financial visibility.

---

## 🔧 Changes Made

### 1. **Payment Rate Calculation** ✅

**Before** (Incorrect):
```typescript
// Calculate payment rate (paid / (paid + sent))
const totalSentAndPaid = sent + paid;
const paymentRate = totalSentAndPaid > 0 
  ? (paid / totalSentAndPaid) * 100 
  : 0;
```
- Only considered "sent" and "paid" invoices
- Ignored draft, overdue, and cancelled invoices
- Gave inaccurate representation of overall payment performance

**After** (Correct):
```typescript
// Calculate payment rate (paid / total invoices) * 100
const paymentRate = total > 0 
  ? (paid / total) * 100 
  : 0;
```
- Considers **all invoices** (draft, sent, paid, overdue, cancelled)
- Shows true percentage of invoices that have been paid
- More accurate financial metric

**Example**:
- 10 total invoices: 2 draft, 3 sent, 4 paid, 1 overdue
- **Before**: (4 / (3 + 4)) × 100 = 57.14% ❌
- **After**: (4 / 10) × 100 = 40% ✅

---

### 2. **"Invoices Sent" → "Unpaid Invoices"** ✅

**Before**:
- Card Label: "Invoices Sent"
- Color: Blue
- Icon: TrendingUp
- Value: `stats.sent` (only "sent" status invoices)

**After**:
- Card Label: **"Unpaid Invoices"**
- Color: **Orange** (warning color)
- Icon: **Clock** (indicates pending)
- Value: `stats.unpaid` (all non-paid invoices)

**Calculation**:
```typescript
const unpaid = invoices.filter((i) => i.status !== 'paid').length;
```
- Includes: draft, sent, overdue, cancelled
- Excludes: only paid invoices
