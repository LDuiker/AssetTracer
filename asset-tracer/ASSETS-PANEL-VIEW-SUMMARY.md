# Assets Panel View - Implementation Complete ✅

## What Was Implemented

Transformed the Assets page to match the Quotations and Invoices layout with a modern panel-based interface.

## How It Works Now

### 1. Click on Any Asset → View Panel Opens
**Before:**
- Click dropdown → View Details → Navigate to new page

**After:**
- Click anywhere on the asset row → View panel slides in (no page change!)

### 2. Consistent Layout with Quotations/Invoices
```
┌─────────────┬────────────────────────────┐
│  Asset List │  Asset Details Panel       │
│  (Sidebar)  │                            │
│             │  - Financial Metrics       │
│  Search     │  - Asset Information       │
│  Filters    │  - Recent Transactions     │
│             │  - Edit/Clone/Delete       │
│  [Assets]   │                            │
└─────────────┴────────────────────────────┘
```

### 3. Quick Actions in View Panel
- ✅ **Edit** - Switch to edit mode in panel
- ✅ **Clone** - Duplicate the asset
- ✅ **Delete** - Remove with confirmation
- ✅ **Back** - Return to list

## New Features

### Financial Summary in View Panel
Now when you view an asset, you see:
- **Purchase Cost** - Original price
- **Current Value** - Latest valuation
- **Total Revenue** - Income from this asset
- **ROI Percentage** - Return on investment

### Transaction History
- Shows last 10 transactions
- Income (green) and Expenses (red)
- Dates and descriptions
- Links to the full transaction system

## Files Created

- Check handleSaveFromPanel function
- Verify API endpoints are working

**List panel too wide/narrow:**
- Adjust width in `assets/page.tsx`: `<div className="w-80">`
- Try `w-64`, `w-96`, or custom width
