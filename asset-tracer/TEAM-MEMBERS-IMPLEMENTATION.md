## üîß Manual Database Operations

INSERT INTO users (id, email, organization_id, role)
VALUES (
  '[auth-user-id]',
  'newmember@example.com',
  '[your-org-id]',
  'member'
);
```

### Check Team Members
```sql
SELECT 
  u.email,
  u.role,
  u.full_name,
  o.name as organization_name
FROM users u
JOIN organizations o ON o.id = u.organization_id
WHERE o.id = '[your-org-id]'
ORDER BY u.created_at;
```

### Check Pending Invitations
```sql
SELECT 
  ti.email,
  ti.role,
  ti.status,
  ti.expires_at,
  u.email as invited_by_email
FROM team_invitations ti
JOIN users u ON u.id = ti.invited_by
WHERE ti.organization_id = '[your-org-id]'
ORDER BY ti.created_at DESC;
```
