## üìä Database Schema

The expenses table includes:
- **Core Fields**: id, organization_id, description, amount, currency, expense_date, vendor
- **Categorization**: category, status, payment_method
- **Asset Linking**: asset_id (nullable, FK to assets table)
- **Tax & Recurrence**: is_tax_deductible, is_recurring, recurring_frequency
- **Documentation**: reference_number, notes, tags, receipt_url
- **Project Linking**: project_id (for future use)
- **Approval Workflow**: approved_by, approved_at
- **Audit Trail**: created_by, created_at, updated_at

## üîó Integration

### Joins with Other Tables
- **Assets** - Expenses can be linked to specific assets
- **Users** - Created_by and approved_by reference users
- **Organizations** - All expenses are scoped to an organization

### Financial Analytics
The expenses are already integrated with the financial analytics system:
- Used by `get_asset_financials()` PostgreSQL function
- Used by `get_monthly_pl()` for P&L calculations
- Included in financial summary for dashboard
