## 🤔 Now I Need More Info

**Please tell me:**

1. **When testing login right now, what EXACT text do you see?**
   - Screenshot would be amazing
   - OR just tell me the exact words

## 🔍 Possible Scenarios

### Scenario A: App Name Not Really Updated

**Check:** On the OAuth consent screen page:
- Scroll to **"App information"** section
- What does **"App name"** field show right now?
- Is it actually "AssetTracer" or something else?

### Scenario B: You're Seeing Supabase Branding Before Google Screen

**Check:** When you click "Continue with Google":
1. **First:** Do you see a page that says `ftelnmursmitpjwjbyrw.supabase.co`?
2. **Then:** Google's sign-in page shows up?

**OR:**
1. Click "Continue with Google"
2. **Directly:** Google's sign-in page shows up
3. **On Google's page**, what does it say at the top?
